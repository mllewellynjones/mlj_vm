Getting Started
======

First install:
- Virtualbox
- Vagrant

Then:
- Get the reload plugin with: 

  `vagrant plugin install vagrant-reload`
    
- `cd` to where you want the machine and run: 

  `git clone git://github.com/mllewellynjones/mlj_vm.git`

- Run `vagrant up` and go and get a coffee, this takes a long time

- `vagrant ssh` into the VM and change the ubuntu password (or create a new user)

- Log into the VM through VirtualBox
