Getting Started
======

First install:
- Virtualbox
- Vagrant
- Git

Then:
- Get the reload plugin with: 

  `vagrant plugin install vagrant-reload`
    
- `cd` to where you want the machine (must be an empty directory) and run: 

  `git clone git://github.com/mllewellynjones/mlj_vm.git`

- Run `vagrant up`. Go and get a coffee, this takes a long time
